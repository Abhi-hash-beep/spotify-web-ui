### ## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Page Navigation:** A cohesive user experience across three distinct, linked pages:
* **Homepage (`index.html`):** A landing page with a welcome message and content grid.
* **Search Page (`search.html`):** A page with a functional search bar UI and "Browse all" categories.
* **Playlist Page (`playlist.html`):** A dynamic template for viewing song lists.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:** The playlist page uses JavaScript to read **URL parameters** (`?name=Playlist+Name`) to determine which playlist's songs to fetch from a data object and render on the screen.
* **Consistent & Responsive UI:** A persistent sidebar and player bar across all pages create a seamless application feel. The layout is structured with modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsiveness.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Clean, reusable components like the sidebar, player bar, and content cards.
* **Iconography:** Uses **Font Awesome** for crisp and recognizable icons, just like the real application.
